# CryptComm
(unfinished) an end-secure LAN messaging server

I'm experimenting with different ideas for security (right now I think I'm going to use python's TLS library and self-signed certs but I'm going to keep looking for better solutions.

I'll also probably look into integrating this with some sort of frontend for the client software as soon as I'm done with the backend functionality.
